* Quick guide
User-input prompt can execute queries that match the scheme below (also can be seen on the page itself):
[[./resources/quick-guide-ebnf.png]]

This scheme means that you can use following commands:
- new item/category - to create an item or a category
- delete item/category - to delete an item or a category
- s - to search your search-query string via google
- o - to open direct-link directly
- t - to change color theme
- item-name - name of some previously saved item in a category, which opens link attached to that item

/Note: All nodes that have dash in their name are variables in prompt/
